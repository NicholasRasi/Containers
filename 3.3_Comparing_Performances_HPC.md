## 3.3 Comparing Performances - HPC

### 3.3.1 Singularity
- [version 3.5.3](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.5.3)

#### Notes

- by default Singularity bind mounts /home/$USER, /tmp, and $PWD into the container at runtime
- the default image Ubuntu 18.10 does not have netcat so it is installed during the %post in the image definition
- to use ping we need [capability](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/security_options.html) CAP_NET_RAW that can be [added](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/admin-guide/configfiles.html#capability-json)

#### Setup
- requires the installation of Golang
- requires sudo for the [installation](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/quick_start.html) but it support the installation [without the root](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/1258) with kernel >= 3.8

#### Image size
- images can be built with a definition file (similar to a Dockerfile) and SIF file is produced
- SIF are immutable, but during testing and debugging an image can be written with the *sandbox* format
- [ubuntu:18.04](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/_container/5baba99394feb900016ea433), amd64:
  - 36 MB (Dockerhub)
  - 36 MB (sif du)
  - 69 MB (Singularity folder du)

#### Memory footprint

- ubuntu:18.04
  - 2 MB with `free -mh`


### 3.3.2 CharlieCloud
- [version 0.15](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/releases/tag/v0.15)

#### Notes

- Charliecloud makes host directories available inside the container using [bind mounts](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/tutorial.html#interacting-with-the-host)

#### Setup

- requires sudo for the [installation](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/blob/master/doc/install.rst) but can be executed without installation

#### Image size
- Ubuntu : 18.04, amd64: 25.49 MB from Dockerhub

- it uses Dockerhub to pull images and then the image is flatten into a tarball with [ch-builder2tar](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/tutorial.html#flatten-image)

- the tarball can be distributed and unpacked

- the tarball size is 25 MB

- the unpacked folder size is 70 MB

- for better performance unpack the image into tmpfs filesystem

- the image is read-only

#### Memory footprint
The process is launched as if it was launched on the interacting-with-the-host, 0 MB measured with `free -mh`

### 3.3.3 Sarus

- version [1.0.1](https://github.com/eth-cscs/sarus/releases/tag/1.0.1)

- last version 1.1.0 does not work

  ```
  WARN[0000] signal: killed

  ```

#### Notes

#### Setup

- the configuration script needs to run with root privileges in order to set Sarus as a root-owned SUID program
- the configuration script requires the program `mksquashfs` to be installed on the system

#### Image size

- Ubuntu : 18.04, amd64: 24.65 MB from Dockerhub, 24.65 MB with `sarus images` and `du`
- the image is then squashed with squashfs
- the image can be downloaded from Dockerhub or loaded from tar archive (exported with Docker)
- images are stored in `~/.sarus/images`

#### Startup time

Ubuntu 18.04:

```
Startup min/mean/max/std duration: 0.1099/0.1280/0.1416/0.0086
Startup + shutdown min/mean/max/std duration: 0.1372/0.1498/0.1651/0.0087
```

#### Memory footprint

- 2 MB measured with `free -mh`

### 3.3.4 Shifter
