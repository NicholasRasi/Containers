### 2.1.1 Docker

### 2.1.2 Podman

#### Introduction

Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers. Podman manages the entire container ecosystem which includes pods, containers, container images, and container volumes using the libpod  library. Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that  help you to maintain and modify OCI container images, such as pulling  and tagging. It allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers created from those images in a production environment.

#### Features

At a high level, the scope of libpod and Podman is the following:

- Support multiple image formats including the OCI and Docker image formats.
- Support for multiple means to securely download images including trust & image verification.
- Container image management (managing image layers, overlay filesystems, etc).
- Full management of container lifecycle.
- Support for pods to manage groups of containers together.
- Resource isolation of containers and pods.
- [rootless installation](https://github.com/containers/libpod#rootless)
- [runc as container runtime](https://github.com/containers/libpod#oci-projects-plans)

#### Requirements and Permissions

#### Images

#### Standards

- [The plan is to use OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects](https://github.com/containers/libpod#oci-projects-plans)

#### Security

When run without root, Podman containers use user namespaces to set root in the container to the user running Podman. Rootless Podman runs locked-down containers with no privileges that the user running the container does not have.

#### Available Tools and Extra
- Runtime: [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) (or any OCI compliant runtime) and [OCI runtime tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) to generate the spec
- Images: Image management using [containers/image](https://github.com/containers/image)
- Storage: Container and image storage is managed by [containers/storage](https://github.com/containers/storage)
- Networking: Networking support through use of [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)
- Builds: Builds are supported via [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah).
- Conmon: [Conmon](https://github.com/containers/conmon) is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes.
