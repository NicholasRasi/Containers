# 3. Comparison Definition
#### Notes

#### Setup

#### Image size
The size of the image is measured with the `du` command and with other commands provided by the container solution, when available

#### Startup time

This test:

- does not depend on the application type
- is simple to implement and equal for all the container solutions

###### Implementation

Start the container and send a single character with netcat. Measure the time between the container is started and the character is received.

Start the container and execute the following command
```
echo -n 'm' | nc -q0 127.0.0.1 1234
```

On the same machine we run
```
nc -l 1234 | hexdump -C
```
to wait for the character.

Measured 10 times, in seconds, waiting 1 second between each measurement

#### Memory footprint (idle)
The container is launched and the memory footprint is measured with the `free -m` command and with other commands provided by the container solution, when available	

#### Application Performance

Use a benchmark application to measure how the container performs
