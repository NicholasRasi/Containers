### Notes

Notes about application dependency, installation, etc.

### Setup

Information about the setup

### Non App Related Performance

Measured on a single bare-metal server in order to get precise measurements limiting any possibile bias and variance that virtualization can introduce.

#### Image Size
The size of the image is measured with the `du` command and with other commands provided by the container solution, when available

#### Memory Footprint (idle)

The container is launched and the memory footprint is measured with the `free -m` command and with other commands provided by the container solution, when available

#### Startup Time Singular Container

This test:

- does not depend on the application type
- is simple to implement to avoid measurement errors
- can be implemented for all the container solutions

###### Implementation

Start the container and send a single character with netcat. Measure the time between the container is started and the character is received.

Start the container and execute the following command
```
echo -n 'm' | nc -q0 127.0.0.1 1234
```

On the same machine we run
```
nc -l 1234 | hexdump -C
```
to wait for the character.

Measured multiples times, in seconds, waiting 1 second between each measurement

#### Startup Time Mutiple Containers

Launch a given number of containers one after another one and measure the startup, stop time while measuring the memory consumption
